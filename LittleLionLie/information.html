            	<h2>Natalie Karlsson, A.k.a. LittleLionLie</h2>
                <p>
                	Natalie Karlsson (LittleLionLie) is a Swedish art student who loves testing out a variety of
					different art styles and art materials. She's mostly recognized by the high contrast between
					her colorful artworks and her black and white horror illustrations.
				</p>
                <p>
					Aside from her artistic interest, she enjoys thigs like YouTube, games, cartoons and music.
					These are big inspirational sources to her art works and they are most likely to shine
					through in the form of fanart or in other referential manners.
				</p>
                <p>
                	She's currently studying comic art design in Malm√∂, which she enjoys greatly and has plans
					on continuing studying this further in the future after high school.
                </p>
                <p>
					She's available on various social media, e.g. Instagram and DeviantArt, which you can find
					under links.
                </p>
                <p>
					I hope you'll find her art just as cool and cute as me.
